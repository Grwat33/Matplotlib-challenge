Pymaceuticals Observations
--------------------------
1. For Mouse ID i557, the regimen Capomulin helped bring down the tumor volume significantly from timepoint 0 to 5, but then the tumor volume
   increased from timepoint 5 to 45, past its original size. Perhaps Capomulin is effective in the short term, but its long term benefits are weak.  

2. The correlation coefficient is .84, recommending that weight and tumor volume have a strong positive relationship. This makes sense as the more
   a mouse weighs, the more room there is for the tumor to grow.

3. The mice population was 50.403% male and 49.597% female. This makes sense as there were originally 249 mice, 124 female and 125 male, but we 
   dropped a female due to its duplicate value, which left 248 mice, 123 female and 125 male. So, the male percentage should be just a bit more
   than the female.
